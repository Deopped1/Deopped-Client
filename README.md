# Deopped Client
After keeping this mod private for a prolonged period, I've decided to share it with the community as I am now in college and no longer actively play the game

This client contains all the mods I have previously published on youtube, now enhanced and combined into a single, unified mod. Additionally, this mod includes many features that I haven't published on youtube.

There won't be any further updates to the mod in the near future, but with 99% of the features being update-proof, it should continue to work seamlessly, so you can keep using it without any issues.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Deopped1/deopped-client-1.43/releases) page.
2. Copy the downloaded file into your Minecraft `mods` folder.
